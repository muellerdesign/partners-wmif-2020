<h2>Recap | April 25</h2>
<p><strong>World Medical Innovation Forum: Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />
<em>1,700 registrants, 140 executive presenters and key leaders shape the future of artificial intelligence!</em></p>
<p>The third day of the World Medical Innovation Forum featured a series of panel discussions and fireside chats that focused on ways that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the performance and data-gathering capabilities of medical devices, reduce health care costs, improve operational efficiencies across the healthcare system and mine new insights from clinical and research data.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the magnitude of the information we have available to us in this space, you think about where technology is today and the compute horsepower that is available to all of us, it just makes sense to continue to evaluate technologies like artificial intelligence to be able to streamline not just operational and administrative efficiency, but be able to make more informed and timely decisions,&#8221; said Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumInsight and Enterprise Growth Officer at Optum, during a discussion on how AI technologies could factor into healthcare reimbursement systems.</p>
<p>Another engaging discussion focused on the concerns that AI technologies may eventually replace human pathologists and radiologists in diagnosing patients. The message from the speakers on this panel was that AI tools should be viewed as a friend, not a foe.</p>
<p>Constance Lehman, MD, PhD, Chief of Breast Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), said AI technologies have helped make imaging services at MGH more precise, targeted and personalized while reducing repetitive tasks that lead to burnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt this is on the friend side and a really powerful technology,&#8221; said Andrew Beck, MD, PhD, CEO, of PathAI. &#8220;The types of problems we are interested in solving are really hard and big and we&#8217;re very far from being able to effectively solve them, even with the AI of today. We&#8217;re very lucky that we have the access to these new technologies that will assist the profession.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s Fireside Chat sessions provided valuable insights from healthcare leaders in the government, technology and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this industry for nearly four decades now. I honestly believe that I have never seen a technology that&#8217;s as transformative as this one,&#8221; said John Kelly, PhD, Senior Vice President for Cognitive Solutions and Research at IBM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity is enormous to transform this industry for better outcomes, lower costs for the benefit of all,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now into the hard work portion of this. It is not easy to build a very intelligent, at scale, precise artificial intelligence system to be injected in the workflow of a clinical physician or a drug researcher. That is a big job. And by the way, you better have heck of a lot of good data to train that system.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Disruptive Dozen: 12 AI Technologies That Will Reinvent Care</h2>
<p>The forum concluded on Wednesday afternoon with the presentation of the Disruptive Dozen, 12 technologies that faculty members in the Partners HealthCare System (PHS) believe have the potential to significantly advance healthcare in the next decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://worldmedicalinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partners-FORUM-2018-BROCHURE-D12-AI-180410_1202-FREV2-FOR-WEB-X3.pdf" target="blank">Follow this link to read all twelve.</a></p>

<h2>First Look Winners Announced!</h2>
<p>Congratulations to First Look presenters Sabine Wilhelm, PhD, from MGH and Ziad Obermeyer, MD, from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) for winning the Peter K. Ranney Innovation Award!</p>
<p>The award was presented at last night&#8217;s Innovator&#8217;s Dinner to honor the BWH and MGH First Look presenters who embodied the innovative, entrepreneurial and visionary spirit the World Medical Innovation Forum was established to recognize.</p>
<p>Here is some of the feedback the judges provided for the winners:</p>
<h5><em>Mobile Apps: Bridging the Mental Health Treatment Gap</em></h5>
<p><strong>Sabine Wilhelm, PhD</strong><br />
The concept of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a mobile app reduces traditional barriers to mental health treatment and tackles cost and access issues head on.<br />
Given the well demonstrated market need for better mental health care paradigms and relative maturity of the technology, the app may benefit from a potentially short commercialization timeline.<br />
The app is well positioned to passively collect substantial data that can inform computational models used to personalize treatment and provide real-time interventions.</p>
<h5><em>A Machine Learning Algorithm to Reduce Costs and Increase Quality</em></h5>
<p><strong>Ziad Obermeyer, MD</strong><br />
The presentation addressed the kind of multi-variate clinical challenges that AI/ML based approaches are well suited to address.<br />
The research has potential for dramatic impact on both cost and quality.<br />
There is real opportunity to expand the approach across clinical domains and disease conditions-a big idea with the potential for broad impact.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 24</h2>
<p><strong>The Role of AI in Health Care Accessibility and Drug Discovery</strong><br />
<em>A closer look at how to turn the promise of implementing AI in health care into a reality.</em></p>
<p>Day 2 of the World Medical Innovation Forum was packed with in-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the health care system, with an up-close look at the role AI could play in delivering affordable health care, supporting clinical decision making, processing large amounts of data and speeding up drug development.</p>
<p>The discussion also highlighted some key challenges in AI integration, such as convincing clinicians, patients and payors of the value of AI technology, standardizing data across platforms, and protecting patient privacy in a digitized world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4332" src="https://worldmedicalinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" /></a></p>
<h2>The Importance of Data</h2>
<p>Data collection was a key topic in many sessions throughout the day. &#8220;The theme you will hear over and over is very high quality, well-curated data,&#8221; said Mark Murcko, PhD, Chief Science Officer of Relay Therapeutics, during a session on drug development. &#8220;One of the big challenges we have is to better represent the interactions that molecules are having. Just to tease out that little bit of insight that helps the drug discovery team move a little faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>A panel discussion on Data Engineering in Health Care emphasized the importance of engaging patients in discovery process and convincing them that the benefits of sharing their health information with clinicians and researchers outweigh the risks of a potential data breach.</p>
<p>James Mault, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Qualcomm Life, noted that 15 years ago many people were hesitant about using their credit cards to make purchases online, but today nearly everyone has their information stored on website such as Amazon because of the convenience it provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is still there, but we&#8217;re willing to accept that risk because we&#8217;re getting these tremendous benefits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In health care we&#8217;re seeing a lot of risk, but we&#8217;re not yet seeing a lot of benefit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Day 2 also featured a series of one-on-one fireside chats. Atul Gawande, MD, a surgeon at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) and bestselling author of Being Mortal and The Checklist Manifesto (among others), told Brigham Health President Elizabeth Nabel, MD, that the key to successfully integrating AI technology into clinical care is to identify clear benefits for both the patient and the clinician-and to ensure that the health care providers are ready and willing to use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give people a great process solution, the perfect innovation tool, and plug it into a ready environment, you make a major impact.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4333" src="https://worldmedicalinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="133" /></a></p>
<h2>Afternoon Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>In a panel session on AI and Genetic Sequencing, moderator Heidi Rehm, PhD, said that while researchers are now able to collect much more genetic data from patients, their ability to process and take action on that data is still lagging behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team in my laboratory still reads articles in the literature to try to figure out what these variants mean,&#8221; Rehm said. &#8220;We will never be able to disseminate these technologies for broad medical use if we can&#8217;t advance what we are doing today in terms of understanding the genetic and genomic variation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised and the work that still needs to be done, the tone of the day&#8217;s sessions were overwhelming positive, with nearly all participants saying they believed that AI technology could make significant improvements in the delivery of health care.</p>
<p>In a CEO roundtable discussion hosted by Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital, Terri Bresenham, Chief Executive Officer for GE Healthcare, shared her optimistic outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very bullish,&#8221; Bresenham said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s no doubt that this will be by far the most transformational technology change that is going to occur, in concert with some other very important changes in genomics and genetics and biotherapies as well as diagnostics and imaging technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Recap | April 23</h2>
<p><strong>A Sell Out Crowd</strong></p>
<p>The fourth annual World Medical Innovation Forum (WMIF) sponsored by Partners Innovation, kicked off Monday morning with a record attendance of 1,600 participants representing the top healthcare, biotech and venture capital firms from across the globe.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s forum is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and much of the discussion on Day One focused on the promise, complexities and limitations of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Speakers were optimistic about the potential for AI to drive big improvements in predicting disease, treating patients and managing outcomes, but also cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages and there will likely be some growing pains along the way.</p>
<p>In her opening remarks, Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of the Partners HealthCare system (PHS), noted that PHS has been investing in the large-scale aggregation and collection of clinical data that can be used to power AI technologies, and is well position to serve as an AI hub with collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was impressed by the speakers and participants at the forum. &#8220;This is what I call rock star city,&#8221; Baker said in his opening remarks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such a terrific collection of intellectual capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://worldmedicalinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-1-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4299" src="https://worldmedicalinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First Look: Next Wave of AI Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>In what has become a must-see event to kick off the forum, Monday&#8217;s First Look Session provided attendees with a look at 19 new innovations in AI-powered medical applications from investigators in the PHS system.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of applications was impressive, including innovations in psychiatry, surgery, genetic profiling, in vitro fertilization, predicting C. difficile infection rates and blood group typing, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Ziad Obermeyer, MD, an emergency medicine clinician at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH), presented a concept for using machine learning algorithm to improve the decision making process for costly medical tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing errors on both sides,&#8221; Dr. Obermeyer explained. &#8220;Predictably low risk patients are getting tested and predictability high risk patients are not getting tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing clear to me is that anything would be better than what we are doing today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone that doctors make mistakes, but we can use these algorithms to find out where and with whom those doctors make mistakes. Building on this understanding, you can come to a whole range of possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Hashimoto, MD, a surgical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), presented on a system called &#8220;Surgical Fingerprints&#8221; that is designed to reduce the risk of adverse intra-operative events by collecting data from previous surgeries and using that information to guide real-time decision making in the operating room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like [the popular direction-finding app] Waze for surgery, but instead of avoiding traffic, it will allow you to avoid surgical complications,&#8221; Hashimoto explained.</p>
<h2>Discovery Café Workshops</h2>
<p>Following the First Look event, the crowd broke out into smaller groups for a series of Discovery Café Sessions taking a closer look at the potential for AI in pathology, anesthesiology, neurosciences, data security and the workforce.</p>
<p>In the neurosciences session, Maurizio Fava, MD, director of the Division of Clinical Research at MGH and the vice chair of the MGH Department of Psychiatry, noted that 20 percent of clinical trial participants never actually take the drug that is being tested,. Fava said he was hopeful that AI technology could help to identify and screen out those participants to improve the accuracy of results.</p>

<h2>Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>Monday afternoon&#8217;s panel sessions began with a big picture view of AI in healthcare before digging deeper into specific areas of interest, such as the role of AI in drug development; the interaction of AI with electronic health records and the role of AI in improving clinical trials.</p>
<p>Tom Lynch, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb, was optimistic that AI could help to streamline the movement of new molecules from discovery to development. The current process &#8220;takes way too long and costs way too much,&#8221; he said.</p>
