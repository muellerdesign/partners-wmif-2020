										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="subheadline">Medical Imaging, Mental Health, Suicide Prevention Make the List of Coming Applications</h2>
<div id="content-L2">
<p>Partners HealthCare today announced its selections for the fifth annual “Disruptive Dozen,” the 12 emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the greatest potential to impact health care in the next year. The technologies were featured as part of the World Medical Innovation Forum (wmif19.sitedistrict.com) held in Boston to examine AI in clinical care including a range of diseases and health system opportunities.</p>
<p>“Understanding state-of-the-art medical technologies enables us to anticipate the future of clinical care,” says Gregg Meyer, MD, Chief Clinical Officer, Partners HealthCare and 2019 World Forum Co-Chair.  “The Disruptive Dozen technologies can offer physicians and patients a renewed sense of optimism about Artificial Intelligence and its impact on diagnosis and treatment.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Partners HealthCare Disruptive Dozen are:</p>
<p><b>1 Reimagining Medical Imaging</b> – AI is transforming radiology and imaging, including mammography and ultrasound, to bring improvements in clinical care and diagnoses to patients worldwide. Researchers envision AI transforming mammography from one-size-fits-all to a more targeted tool for assessing breast cancer risk, and further increasing utility for ultrasound for disease detection and rapid acquisition of clinical-grade images.</p>
<p><b>2 Better Prediction of Suicide Risk</b> – Suicide is the 10<sup>th</sup> leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death among young people. AI is proving powerful in helping identify patients at risk of suicide (based on EHR data,) and also examining social media content with the goal of detecting early warning signs of suicide. These efforts toward an early warning system could help alert physicians, mental health professionals and family members when someone in their care needs help. These technologies are under development and not cleared for clinical use.</p>
<p><b>3 Streamlining Diagnosis </b>– The application of AI in clinical workflows such as imaging and pathology is ushering in a new era of AI-enabled disease diagnosis. From identifying abnormal and potentially life-threatening findings in medical imaging, to screening pathology cases according to the presence of urgent findings such as cancer cells, AI is poised to aid the diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment decisions that clinicians make while caring for patients.</p>
<p><b>4 Automated Malaria Detection </b>&#8212; Nearly half a million people succumbed to malaria in 2017, with the majority being children under five. Deep learning technologies are helping automate malaria diagnosis, with software to detect and quantify malaria parasites with 90 percent accuracy and specificity. Such an automated approach to malaria detection and diagnosis could benefit millions of people worldwide by helping to deliver more accurate and timely diagnoses and could enable better monitoring of treatment efficacy.</p>
<p><b>5 Real-time Monitoring and Analysis of Brain Health – a Window on the Brain – </b>A new world of real-time monitoring of the brain promises to dramatically improve patient care. By automating the manual and painstaking analysis of EEGs and other high-frequency wave forms, clinicians can rapidly detect electrical abnormalities that signal trouble.  Deep learning algorithms based on terabytes of EEG data are helping to automatically detect seizures in the critically ill, regardless of the underlying cause of illness.</p>
<p><b>6 “A-Eye”: Artificial Intelligence for Eye Health and Disease </b>– Not only is AI is helping advance new approaches in ophthalmology, it’s demonstrating the ability of AI-enabled technologies to enhance primary care with specialty level diagnostics. In 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new AI-based system for the detection of diabetic retinopathy, marking the first fully automated, AI-based diagnostic tool approved for market in the U.S. that does not require additional expert review. The technology could also play a role in low-resource settings, where access to ophthalmologic care may be limited.</p>
<p><b>7 Lighting a “FHIR” Under Health Information Exchange &#8212; </b>A new data standard, known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) has become the de facto standard for sharing medical and other health-related information. With its modern, web-based approach to health information exchange, FHIR promises to enable a new world of possibilities rooted in patient-centered care. While this new world is just emerging, it promises to give patients unfettered access to their own health information — allowing them to decide what they want to share and with whom and demanding careful consideration of data privacy and security.</p>
<p><b>8 Reducing the Burden of Health Care Administration &#8212; </b>use of AI to automate routine and highly repetitious administrative functions. In the U.S., more than 25% of health care expenditures are due to administrative costs, far surpassing all other developed nations. One important area where AI could have a sizeable impact is medical coding and billing, where AI can develop automated approaches. The goal is to help reduce the complexity of the coding and billing process thereby reducing the number of mistakes and minimize the need for intense regulatory oversight.</p>
<p><b>9 A Revolution in Acute Stroke Care &#8212; </b>Stroke is a major cause of death and disability across the world and a significant source of health care spending. Each year in the U.S., nearly 800,000 people suffer from a stroke, with a cost of roughly $34 billion. AI tools to help automate the diagnostic journey of ischemic stroke can help determine whether there is bleeding within the brain — a crucial early insight that helps doctors select the proper treatment. These algorithms can automatically review a patient’s head CT scan to identify a cerebral hemorrhage as well as help localize its source and determine the volume of brain tissue affected.</p>
<p><b>10 The Hidden Signs of Intimate Partner Violence </b>– Researchers are working to develop AI-enabled tools that can help alert clinicians if a patient’s injuries likely stem from intimate partner violence (IPV). Through an AI-enabled system, they hope to help break the silence that surrounds IPV by empowering clinicians with powerful, data-driven tools. While screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) can help detect and prevent future violence, less than 30% of IPV cases seen in the ER are appropriately flagged as abuse-related. Health care providers are optimistic that AI tools will further complement their role as a trusted source for divulging abuse.</p>
<p><b>11 Voice-first Technology Comes to Health Care &#8212; </b>AI-powered, voice-first technology is coming to the clinic. Using speech recognition and natural language processing, several companies are developing tools designed to help clinicians deliver better care and provide more of what matters: quality time with patients. Voice assistants are being explored for reducing physicians’ data entry burdens. Health care technology companies are developing applications that can run on consumer-grade voice technology platforms while complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.</p>
<p><b>12 Narrowing the Gaps in Mental Health Care &#8212; </b>In the U.S., mental illness has reached epidemic proportions; nearly one in five adults grapples with a mental disorder, and opioid addiction and misuse claim the lives of more than 130 adults every day. Promising innovation is being seen in the integration of rigorously validated mental health methods into smartphone apps. One AI app under development is for patients with opioid, alcohol, and other forms of drug addiction with co-occurring mental illness. The app provides patients with a virtual form of integrated group therapy (IGT), a highly effective treatment that teaches behaviors and skills to manage recovery and prevent relapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>The MGH &amp; BWH Center for Clinical Data Science wants to put AI in the toolbox of every researcher and clinician  </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Boston, MA April 08, 2019</strong> – At the World Medical Innovation Forum 2019, Partners HealthCare today announced a commitment to put artificial intelligence (AI) in the toolbox of all of its researchers and clinicians. These efforts, being spearheaded by the MGH &amp; BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS), focus on providing researchers and clinicians with access to data, GPU (graphics processing unit) compute capacity and supporting software required to develop their own AI algorithms to be implemented in the clinical environment.</p>
<p>CCDS is planning broad roll-out to the Partners system over the next 12 months and is already offering AI capabilities and support services. This announcement aligns with national and global trends towards democratization of AI capabilities through increasingly collaborative efforts between academic organizations, technology companies and organizations like the American College of Radiology (ACR) that work to establish standards for the field.</p>
<p>“Currently, focused and siloed pockets of domain expertise in AI reside within specific departments or labs at several large academic medical centers, but making AI an enabling technology across the field of healthcare has been a challenge for many facilities” said Keith Dreyer, DO, PhD, FACR, FSIIM, Chief Data Science Officer, Partners HealthCare. “The truth is, you don’t have to be a computer scientist or data scientist to participate in the creation of AI – we are just starting to see increasing availability of tools to enable on-premises development of AI models by clinicians.”</p>
<p>The trend is punctuated by the recent announcement of a free software platform (AI-LAB) being released by the ACR to allow radiologists to develop, validate and implement AI within their own facilities. AI-LAB is a core component of ACR’s vision for the democratization of AI in radiology. The free, vendor-neutral software solution will allow radiologists to work with patient data within their own secure IT environments, while providing opportunities to share AI datasets and algorithms with other institutions. The objective is to facilitate the development of more versatile, generalizable and accurate models – a principle known as transfer learning.</p>
<p>Through collaboration with Nvidia and The Ohio State University (OSU), CCDS has demonstrated the ability for new transfer learning approaches to generate algorithms that are more robust and adaptive to local variation. The specific project involved the transfer of a cardiac Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) model, which was co-developed with Nvidia, to OSU where it was re-trained using OSU data. The resulting model was more accurate and required less effort to train, validate and test. Ittai Dayan, MD, Executive Director of Operations at CCDS underscores the spirit of collaboration. “The concept of transfer learning means that sites can collaborate in building more highly performant algorithms without having to share sensitive patient data – this collaborative approach will dramatically accelerate the rate at which new algorithms are developed and integrated into the clinical workflow.”</p>
<p>The announcement at the World Medical Innovation Forum in Boston, a global conference focusing on the intersection of AI and clinical care, reflects the vital role of innovation in transforming healthcare. The ability for new technologies, like AI, to have a meaningful impact in the field of medicine is highly dependent on collaboration between stakeholders with a unified goal of improving patient lives. At the conference, clinicians, industry and government leaders, entrepreneurs and venture investors are exploring where AI meets clinical care, including the requisite sensitivity to patient data and standards.</p>

<p class="" data-reactid="283">by WBUR</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="283">June 8, 2018- So far, the digital revolution has mostly been a disappointment in health care. Doctors stare at their screens instead of us. Specialists and emergency rooms still don’t have all our records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="284">But artificial intelligence, big data analytics and deep learning are converging on health care in a big way, information technology experts insist. The changes have already begun. And if and when they really take off, such convergence of biology and technology should bring about a complete transformation of medical care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="286">“My personal perspective would be in three to five years, the huge majority of patients will be touched one way or [an]other with some AI-related system, whether they know it or not,” says Chris Coburn, chief innovation officer at Partners HealthCare, who recently led a three-day conference on the topic of artificial intelligence, or AI. “The scope of the potential benefit is at times not easily even imagined.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="287">Coburn and others cite numerous examples where artificial intelligence is already improving health care:</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="288">&#8212; Digital visual analysis is beginning to replace pathologists at identifying dangerous tumors.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="289">&#8212; Devices are increasingly able to monitor patients at home to catch problems before they become serious.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="290">&#8212; Pharmaceutical companies like Amgen and Novartis are using deep learning and artificial intelligence to shorten their drug development process and improve their odds of successfully bringing a drug to market.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="291">&#8212; Cellphones and watch-like mobile devices are increasingly being used to monitor healthy people for changes that might indicate impending problems.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="292">&#8212; And in hospitals, algorithms can help indicate which patients need immediate attention and which should be left alone to rest.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="293">&#8220;Our patient monitoring and guardian algorithms can actually predictively say how a patient is doing,&#8221; says Frans van Houten, head of Royal Philips, the Dutch conglomerate now focused almost entirely on health care technologies.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="294">Houten, whose company is in the process of consolidating its U.S. research operations in Cambridge, says digital algorithms can predict which patients are vulnerable to life-threatening infections and which to heart attacks.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="295">“And that allows the health system to proactively direct staff to the patients that need [care], versus the patients that don’t,” he says. “So our technology can play a big role for precision care and raising productivity.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="296">Similarly, Colin Hill runs a Cambridge company, GNS Healthcare, which analyzes vast amounts of patient data to derive information that can improve care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="297">“We’re on a path to turning the lights on and revealing what works for whom,&#8221; he says. &#8220;And by getting at the underlying mechanisms of these diseases, we can now stop the guesswork. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s really exciting for me.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="298">His company recently used genetic data from a large number of patients with the blood cancer multiple myeloma to identify patterns in those who were helped by a costly, potentially dangerous bone marrow transplant. If the findings are validated, patients whose genetics suggest they wouldn’t benefit could be spared the time, energy, expense and dashed hopes of a fruitless procedure.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="299">Thanks to improvements in artificial intelligence, Hill says, “we’re now able to learn that kind of causality &#8212; those kinds of cause-effect relationships &#8212; straight from real-world data.”</p>

<p class="" data-reactid="306">Hopefully, this will also save money, which is driving the current interest, Hill says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="307">“What&#8217;s changed is the convergence of both the data and the technology capabilities,” he says. “And I think the environment&#8217;s also changed. As a society, we are coming to grips with the fact that we have a health care system that costs far too much and delivers far too little and it is ultimately not sustainable the way it is.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="308">Nobel Laureate and MIT Institute professor Phil Sharp has an even broader vision of this convergence: It’s not just computer science and biology that are converging, but engineering, physics, material science and agriculture too, he says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="309">“Life science is part of all of those processes and bringing physicists and engineering and information technology together to integrate life science with the translation to solving those problems is what convergence is about,” Sharp says. “It&#8217;ll be decades of exciting science and exciting technology.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="310"><strong>&#8216;It Doesn&#8217;t Always Go The Way We Hope&#8217;</strong></p>
<p class="" data-reactid="311">Despite its potential, some people say that artificial intelligence is the future of health care — and always will be. Skepticism remains high because of problems with the electronic health record, which has taken years longer than expected to become functional and constructive.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="312">“We hope that things are going to go well. But specifically in health care it doesn&#8217;t always go the way we hope,” says Andrew Beam, an instructor and junior faculty member in the department of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="313">GNS Healthcare&#8217;s Hill says he finds it annoying when tech people assume it should be easy to bring change to health care.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="314">&#8220;When folks come from the tech world thinking that they&#8217;re going to come and build the iPhone of human disease and health care, one of the reasons why they stumble with it is because the complexity of these systems is just beyond anything we&#8217;ve dealt with,” Hill says. &#8220;It’s a fundamentally different problem.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="315">There is no room for error when someone’s health or life is on the line.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="316">And privacy is an even bigger issue in medicine than on social media. No one wants their medical records on display on the internet.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="317">Beam says that although there is more oversight in medicine, privacy breaches will happen.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="318">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to continue to be a problem,” he says. &#8220;The unfortunate fact in cybersecurity is that the bad guys are always just ahead of the good guys and there&#8217;s sort of an ongoing arms race.&#8221;</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="319">Despite the concerns about digital health, there’s clearly a growing interest in the combination of computer technology and medical care.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="320">Abbie Celniker, a partner Third Rock Ventures, says so far, her venture capital firm hasn’t invested directly in artificial intelligence or machine learning companies. But that day may not be far off.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="321">“We are starting to really do our homework and think about the most optimal places to bring together therapeutic development and digital health,” she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="322">Others are investing, too. Last month, pharma giant Roche <a href="http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180216/NEWS/180219932">spent $1.9 billion</a> to buy Flatiron Health, a New York startup that tries to advance cancer care by analyzing huge datasets of patient records.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="323">Celniker says that most of the companies Third Rock has helped start already use digital technologies to analyze datasets, crunch numbers or improve efficiency.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="324">“But applying it in a bigger way, bringing together more diverse datasets, and having things learned from those very diverse datasets, that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;re just trying now to figure out where&#8217;s the best place to investigate,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="325">Greater Boston has all the necessary ingredients to lead in the area of digital health, a number of local experts say, continuing to keep the so-called BioBoom alive for years to come.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="326">“Digital health is what&#8217;s next. Precision medicine, personalized medicine &#8212; that is what&#8217;s next,” says Bob Coughlin, president and CEO of the nonprofit Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. “Now let&#8217;s ask, where is most of that research in those areas — in digital health and precision medicine? What in gene therapy and immunotherapy and gene modification and exon skipping and CAR-T therapy, CRISPR technology &#8212; where’s most of that happening? Well, folks, you can walk to it right here.”</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="327">Although digital giants like Microsoft and Google are headquartered in Silicon Valley, they now have outposts in Cambridge. They’re the ones driving up the rent in Kendall Square, Coughlin says.</p>
<p class="" data-reactid="328">And there’s a broad range of expertise here, which will be essential for this convergence, Harvard Med&#8217;s Beam says.</p>
<p class="indent-medium" data-reactid="329">&#8220;You can&#8217;t just be a computer scientist working in isolation on artificial intelligence if you want to change biology and medicine,” he says. You have to partner with doctors, engineers and hospital staff. “And no matter what area of biology or medicine would like you to use AI to improve, there is a world expert in that area here Boston.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Recap | April 25</h2>
<p><strong>World Medical Innovation Forum: Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />
<em>1,700 registrants, 140 executive presenters and key leaders shape the future of artificial intelligence!</em></p>
<p>The third day of the World Medical Innovation Forum featured a series of panel discussions and fireside chats that focused on ways that artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to improve the performance and data-gathering capabilities of medical devices, reduce health care costs, improve operational efficiencies across the healthcare system and mine new insights from clinical and research data.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about the magnitude of the information we have available to us in this space, you think about where technology is today and the compute horsepower that is available to all of us, it just makes sense to continue to evaluate technologies like artificial intelligence to be able to streamline not just operational and administrative efficiency, but be able to make more informed and timely decisions,&#8221; said Eric Murphy, CEO of OptumInsight and Enterprise Growth Officer at Optum, during a discussion on how AI technologies could factor into healthcare reimbursement systems.</p>
<p>Another engaging discussion focused on the concerns that AI technologies may eventually replace human pathologists and radiologists in diagnosing patients. The message from the speakers on this panel was that AI tools should be viewed as a friend, not a foe.</p>
<p>Constance Lehman, MD, PhD, Chief of Breast Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), said AI technologies have helped make imaging services at MGH more precise, targeted and personalized while reducing repetitive tasks that lead to burnout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a doubt this is on the friend side and a really powerful technology,&#8221; said Andrew Beck, MD, PhD, CEO, of PathAI. &#8220;The types of problems we are interested in solving are really hard and big and we&#8217;re very far from being able to effectively solve them, even with the AI of today. We&#8217;re very lucky that we have the access to these new technologies that will assist the profession.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PartnersFORUM2018EMAILTEMPLATEBoston180425_1932B-AF3150PHOTO12.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4336" src="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PartnersFORUM2018EMAILTEMPLATEBoston180425_1932B-AF3150PHOTO12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" /></a></p>
<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s Fireside Chat sessions provided valuable insights from healthcare leaders in the government, technology and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in this industry for nearly four decades now. I honestly believe that I have never seen a technology that&#8217;s as transformative as this one,&#8221; said John Kelly, PhD, Senior Vice President for Cognitive Solutions and Research at IBM.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity is enormous to transform this industry for better outcomes, lower costs for the benefit of all,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s now into the hard work portion of this. It is not easy to build a very intelligent, at scale, precise artificial intelligence system to be injected in the workflow of a clinical physician or a drug researcher. That is a big job. And by the way, you better have heck of a lot of good data to train that system.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Disruptive Dozen: 12 AI Technologies That Will Reinvent Care</h2>
<p>The forum concluded on Wednesday afternoon with the presentation of the Disruptive Dozen, 12 technologies that faculty members in the Partners HealthCare System (PHS) believe have the potential to significantly advance healthcare in the next decade.</p>
<p><a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Partners-FORUM-2018-BROCHURE-D12-AI-180410_1202-FREV2-FOR-WEB-X3.pdf" target="blank">Follow this link to read all twelve.</a></p>

<h2>First Look Winners Announced!</h2>
<p>Congratulations to First Look presenters Sabine Wilhelm, PhD, from MGH and Ziad Obermeyer, MD, from Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) for winning the Peter K. Ranney Innovation Award!</p>
<p>The award was presented at last night&#8217;s Innovator&#8217;s Dinner to honor the BWH and MGH First Look presenters who embodied the innovative, entrepreneurial and visionary spirit the World Medical Innovation Forum was established to recognize.</p>
<p>Here is some of the feedback the judges provided for the winners:</p>
<h5><em>Mobile Apps: Bridging the Mental Health Treatment Gap</em></h5>
<p><strong>Sabine Wilhelm, PhD</strong><br />
The concept of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy through a mobile app reduces traditional barriers to mental health treatment and tackles cost and access issues head on.<br />
Given the well demonstrated market need for better mental health care paradigms and relative maturity of the technology, the app may benefit from a potentially short commercialization timeline.<br />
The app is well positioned to passively collect substantial data that can inform computational models used to personalize treatment and provide real-time interventions.</p>
<h5><em>A Machine Learning Algorithm to Reduce Costs and Increase Quality</em></h5>
<p><strong>Ziad Obermeyer, MD</strong><br />
The presentation addressed the kind of multi-variate clinical challenges that AI/ML based approaches are well suited to address.<br />
The research has potential for dramatic impact on both cost and quality.<br />
There is real opportunity to expand the approach across clinical domains and disease conditions-a big idea with the potential for broad impact.</p>

<h2>Recap | April 24</h2>
<p><strong>The Role of AI in Health Care Accessibility and Drug Discovery</strong><br />
<em>A closer look at how to turn the promise of implementing AI in health care into a reality.</em></p>
<p>Day 2 of the World Medical Innovation Forum was packed with in-depth discussions on the opportunities and challenges of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the health care system, with an up-close look at the role AI could play in delivering affordable health care, supporting clinical decision making, processing large amounts of data and speeding up drug development.</p>
<p>The discussion also highlighted some key challenges in AI integration, such as convincing clinicians, patients and payors of the value of AI technology, standardizing data across platforms, and protecting patient privacy in a digitized world.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4332" src="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180424_1742B-AF2150PHOTO12.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" /></a></p>
<h2>The Importance of Data</h2>
<p>Data collection was a key topic in many sessions throughout the day. &#8220;The theme you will hear over and over is very high quality, well-curated data,&#8221; said Mark Murcko, PhD, Chief Science Officer of Relay Therapeutics, during a session on drug development. &#8220;One of the big challenges we have is to better represent the interactions that molecules are having. Just to tease out that little bit of insight that helps the drug discovery team move a little faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>A panel discussion on Data Engineering in Health Care emphasized the importance of engaging patients in discovery process and convincing them that the benefits of sharing their health information with clinicians and researchers outweigh the risks of a potential data breach.</p>
<p>James Mault, MD, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer for Qualcomm Life, noted that 15 years ago many people were hesitant about using their credit cards to make purchases online, but today nearly everyone has their information stored on website such as Amazon because of the convenience it provides.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk is still there, but we&#8217;re willing to accept that risk because we&#8217;re getting these tremendous benefits,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In health care we&#8217;re seeing a lot of risk, but we&#8217;re not yet seeing a lot of benefit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Fireside Chats</h2>
<p>Day 2 also featured a series of one-on-one fireside chats. Atul Gawande, MD, a surgeon at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH) and bestselling author of Being Mortal and The Checklist Manifesto (among others), told Brigham Health President Elizabeth Nabel, MD, that the key to successfully integrating AI technology into clinical care is to identify clear benefits for both the patient and the clinician-and to ensure that the health care providers are ready and willing to use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you give people a great process solution, the perfect innovation tool, and plug it into a ready environment, you make a major impact.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Afternoon Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>In a panel session on AI and Genetic Sequencing, moderator Heidi Rehm, PhD, said that while researchers are now able to collect much more genetic data from patients, their ability to process and take action on that data is still lagging behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team in my laboratory still reads articles in the literature to try to figure out what these variants mean,&#8221; Rehm said. &#8220;We will never be able to disseminate these technologies for broad medical use if we can&#8217;t advance what we are doing today in terms of understanding the genetic and genomic variation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the concerns raised and the work that still needs to be done, the tone of the day&#8217;s sessions were overwhelming positive, with nearly all participants saying they believed that AI technology could make significant improvements in the delivery of health care.</p>
<p>In a CEO roundtable discussion hosted by Peter Slavin, MD, President of Massachusetts General Hospital, Terri Bresenham, Chief Executive Officer for GE Healthcare, shared her optimistic outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re very bullish,&#8221; Bresenham said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s no doubt that this will be by far the most transformational technology change that is going to occur, in concert with some other very important changes in genomics and genetics and biotherapies as well as diagnostics and imaging technology.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Recap | April 23</h2>
<p><strong>A Sell Out Crowd</strong></p>
<p>The fourth annual World Medical Innovation Forum (WMIF) sponsored by Partners Innovation, kicked off Monday morning with a record attendance of 1,600 participants representing the top healthcare, biotech and venture capital firms from across the globe.</p>
<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s forum is Artificial Intelligence (AI), and much of the discussion on Day One focused on the promise, complexities and limitations of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Speakers were optimistic about the potential for AI to drive big improvements in predicting disease, treating patients and managing outcomes, but also cautioned that the technology is still in its early stages and there will likely be some growing pains along the way.</p>
<p>In her opening remarks, Anne Klibanski, MD, Chief Academic Officer of the Partners HealthCare system (PHS), noted that PHS has been investing in the large-scale aggregation and collection of clinical data that can be used to power AI technologies, and is well position to serve as an AI hub with collaborators worldwide.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker was impressed by the speakers and participants at the forum. &#8220;This is what I call rock star city,&#8221; Baker said in his opening remarks. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen such a terrific collection of intellectual capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-1-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4299" src="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-1-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>First Look: Next Wave of AI Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>In what has become a must-see event to kick off the forum, Monday&#8217;s First Look Session provided attendees with a look at 19 new innovations in AI-powered medical applications from investigators in the PHS system.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of applications was impressive, including innovations in psychiatry, surgery, genetic profiling, in vitro fertilization, predicting C. difficile infection rates and blood group typing, just to name a few.</p>
<p>Ziad Obermeyer, MD, an emergency medicine clinician at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital (BWH), presented a concept for using machine learning algorithm to improve the decision making process for costly medical tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing errors on both sides,&#8221; Dr. Obermeyer explained. &#8220;Predictably low risk patients are getting tested and predictability high risk patients are not getting tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing clear to me is that anything would be better than what we are doing today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t come as a surprise to anyone that doctors make mistakes, but we can use these algorithms to find out where and with whom those doctors make mistakes. Building on this understanding, you can come to a whole range of possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Daniel Hashimoto, MD, a surgical resident at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), presented on a system called &#8220;Surgical Fingerprints&#8221; that is designed to reduce the risk of adverse intra-operative events by collecting data from previous surgeries and using that information to guide real-time decision making in the operating room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like [the popular direction-finding app] Waze for surgery, but instead of avoiding traffic, it will allow you to avoid surgical complications,&#8221; Hashimoto explained.</p>
<h2>Discovery Café Workshops</h2>
<p>Following the First Look event, the crowd broke out into smaller groups for a series of Discovery Café Sessions taking a closer look at the potential for AI in pathology, anesthesiology, neurosciences, data security and the workforce.</p>
<p>In the neurosciences session, Maurizio Fava, MD, director of the Division of Clinical Research at MGH and the vice chair of the MGH Department of Psychiatry, noted that 20 percent of clinical trial participants never actually take the drug that is being tested,. Fava said he was hopeful that AI technology could help to identify and screen out those participants to improve the accuracy of results.</p>
<p><a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4300" src="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/180423_1722-B-AF-1-150-PHOTO-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="133" /></a></p>
<h2>Panel Sessions</h2>
<p>Monday afternoon&#8217;s panel sessions began with a big picture view of AI in healthcare before digging deeper into specific areas of interest, such as the role of AI in drug development; the interaction of AI with electronic health records and the role of AI in improving clinical trials.</p>
<p>Tom Lynch, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of Bristol Myers Squibb, was optimistic that AI could help to streamline the movement of new molecules from discovery to development. The current process &#8220;takes way too long and costs way too much,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Notable Tweets</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Health IT Analytics</p>
<p><time datetime="2018-3-21">March 21, 2018</time> &#8211; Despite the fact that the healthcare industry hit its EHR saturation point some time ago, providers and vendors are still eagerly engaged in dialogue about the utilization and continued optimization of health IT tools.</p>
<p>But the topics of debate have shifted away from how to become a digital enterprise and towards something bigger and more visionary: <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/how-healthcare-can-prep-for-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning">how to use</a> an organization’s growing data assets to measurably impact cost, patient-provider experiences, and the quality of care.</p>
<p>No discussion of these critical issues would be complete without at least a passing mention of machine learning and artificial intelligence – and for many organizations, including Partners Healthcare, these emerging strategies are at the center of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Artificial intelligence will have succeeded when we no longer talk about it,” said Mark Michalski, MD, Executive Director of the MGH &amp; BWH Center for Clinical Data Science.  “The health system will simply be smarter and better without the need to distinguish it from anything else.”</p>
<p>“But for now, it’s something that we do need to talk about because there’s so much to discover and so many opportunities to refine our thinking and our approaches.”</p>
<p>Partners Healthcare, which includes notable facilities such as Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is taking a leading role as a convener of those conversations by hosting the <a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/">World Medical Innovation Forum on Artificial Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>The three-day event, held in Boston on April 23-25, 2018, will bring Partners experts, Harvard Medical School faculty, and numerous luminaries from the developer and vendor community to set the expectations and potential for AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>“We are at this very exciting pivot point in healthcare, and AI is a catalyst accelerating the industry’s transformation,” says Partners Healthcare Chief Information Officer Christopher Coburn. “It isn’t going to take long at all for the effects of AI to spread across all of healthcare.”</p>
<p>Many medical disciplines are already feeling those effects, agreed Michalski.  A radiologist by training, he is keenly aware that artificial intelligence is already becoming a force to be reckoned with in image-based specialties.</p>
<p>“Machine learning has <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/ai-for-imaging-analytics-intrigues-healthcare-orgs-yet-starts-slow">tremendous promise</a> for diagnostics, including in my field of radiology,” he told <em>HealthITAnalytics.com</em>.  “It is very good at processing images, and characterizing the features in those images, to make radiologists more efficient and help them make their reports more quantitative and useful for the patients they serve.”</p>
<p>However, these early success don’t mean that artificial intelligence is going to be taking the place of pathologists, radiologists, and other diagnosticians in the near future.</p>
<p>While it is easy to get caught up in predictions of autonomous AI clinicians, Michalski suggests a bit of <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/features/navigating-the-hype-of-healthcare-artificial-intelligence-companies">healthy skepticism</a> about the notion that highly-trained individuals will be supplanted by machines any time soon.</p>
<p>“We’re hearing a lot in the popular press about the power of this technology, and there are articles coming out from some very smart people that say artificial intelligence will replace certain job functions or categories, which can be a little bit intimidating or even a little frightening,” he acknowledged.</p>
<p>“That comes from not yet fully understanding the boundaries of this technology and what it is really capable of doing.”</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence may be starting to get very good at classification, but human intelligence is still required to supervise AI efforts and cast a critical eye over its results.</p>
<p>“AI is very accomplished at some things, but it’s still not very good at performing other tasks,” Michalski noted.  “At the Center for Clinical Data Science, part of our mission is to define those boundaries and understand how these tools fail so we can improve them.  If AI was perfect, we wouldn’t have so much work to do every day.”</p>
<p>Instead of replacing clinicians entirely, both Michalski and Coburn believe AI will take an important supporting role.</p>
<p>“There’s a great quote that’s along the lines of ‘not all radiologists will be replaced by AI, but the radiologists who are not expert in AI will be replaced by the ones who are,’” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“AI is going to help clinicians of all types improve the things they’re doing right now.  And it will also enable some things that have never been done before. Clinicians are curious about what that is going to look like and how AI can help them become more effective and efficient.”</p>
<p>Using artificial intelligence to improve operational efficiencies and <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/can-artificial-intelligence-relieve-electronic-health-record-burnout">the EHR workflow</a> are very attractive use cases, he added.</p>
<p>“A lot of folks feel like the rise of electronic health records is coming between physicians and their patients,” he said.  “AI has the potential to reinforce the human aspect of healthcare and pull back a lot of the clumsiness of the technology interfaces we have today.  There’s a lot of hopefulness around that.”</p>
<p>Top executives and developers from a number of organizations, including Epic Systems, Change Healthcare, Optum, Nuance, Microsoft, and Health Catalyst will share their views on how to create more intuitive EHRs and more intelligent decision-making opportunities in both the clinical and operational environments.</p>
<p><a href="https://phc-wmif20.muellerarchive.com/agenda/">Other sessions</a> will focus on the role of AI in drug development and precision medicine, as well as the challenges of regulating technologies that leverage brand new approaches to collecting, analyzing, and sharing big data.</p>
<p>“You’re going to see luminaries who are leading their segments of the field right now as well as folks who will be the absolute stars of their disciplines in five or ten years,” said Coburn.</p>
<p>“And there are no PowerPoints,” he added.  “We have worked hard to create opportunities for shared insights in a very rich, discussion-based format.  It’s all about communicating actionable ideas through conversations, which I think is the best way to learn.”</p>
<p>To close out the event, Partners will be putting its money where its mouth is, Coburn continued, by awarding grant funding to a series of new machine learning and AI tools developed within the Partners community.</p>
<p>“We’re going to announce the ten internal technologies that we’re going to put $50,000 against,” he said.  “That’s $50,000 each.  We’ll also be sharing our faculty’s selections of the twelve AI technologies they think will be most disruptive over the next decade.”</p>
<p>The event is designed to provide a comprehensive look at how artificial intelligence is currently used – and how it will evolve over the next few years – to significantly <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare-gets-cheaper-and-quicker">disrupt the health IT status quo</a>, said Coburn.</p>
<p>Clinicians, developers, data scientists, health IT leaders, investors, and provider executives are all encouraged to attend the crash-course in machine learning and its impacts on the industry, he urged.</p>
<p>“If you only had three days in all of 2018 to devote to AI, these would be the three days you’d want to spend doing it,” said Coburn.  “You’ll come out of there having learned what technologies are going to make the biggest impact and what areas of healthcare will be most affected by them.”</p>
<p>“It’ll be excellent preparation for making the right moves in your own organization, and we could all use as much preparation as we can get when it comes to making important decisions.”</p>
